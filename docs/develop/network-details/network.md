This index guide contains network details for the Mumbai testnet and Polygon PoS mainnet and 
lists their associated RPC and node endpoints.

## Mumbai PoS Testnet

Mumbai Testnet replicates the Polygon Mainnet and is used for testing. Users can obtain
testnet tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
Testnet tokens are valueless and are different from value-bearing assets like MATIC.
This allows developers or network maintainers to test configurations and experiment implementations.

## Polygon PoS Mainnet

The native token of the Polygon PoS is MATIC and is used for gas.

## RPC API Methods

Developers can interact with on-chain data and send different types of transactions to 
the network by utilizing network endpoints. The API follows a JSON-RPC standard;
JSON-RPC is a stateless, lightweight, remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is 
commonly used when interacting with a blockchain network.

:::info Get started with RPC calls

Start by visiting the complete set of API documentation for standard 
[**Polygon JSON-RPC calls**](https://edge-docs.polygon.technology/docs/get-started/json-rpc-commands/).

If you want to get started with API requests that require no setup, fix failing requests, or, 
explore new methods on the Polygon network, try out the [**Composer App**](https://composer.alchemyapi.io?composer_state=%7B%22chain%22%3A2%2C%22network%22%3A401%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getBlockByNumber%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%22latest%22%2Cfalse%5D%7D).

:::

A user can also run their own node when interacting with the Polygon PoS chain or utilize
one of the public endpoints provided by infrastructure and API service providers to connect to 
the network. Dagger is the best way to get realtime updates from the chain as it provides a way 
for your dApps and backend system to get blockchain events in realtime over a socket or websocket.
