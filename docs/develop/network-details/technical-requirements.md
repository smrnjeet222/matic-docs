For the upcoming testnet event, this is the minimal hardware configuration:

### Minimal hardware Configuration for Full Node
- RAM: 16-32 GB
- CPU: 4-8 core CPU (t3 xLarge)
- Storage: Minimum 1.2TB SSD (make sure it is extendable)

:::tip

The minimum storage requirements grow as the network grows.
It is recommended to use more than the minimum requirements to run a robust full node.

:::

While we do not favor any operating system, **more secure and stable** Linux server distributions (like CentOS) should be preferred over desktop operating systems (like Mac OS and Windows).

:::note
Requirements like storage space will change over time
