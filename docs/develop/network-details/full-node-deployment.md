We have created simple Ansible playbooks to se tup a full node.

Pre-requisites:

- Ansible should be installed on local machine with Python3.x. The setup will not work if you have Python2.x.
    - To install ansible with Python 3.x you can use this command `pip3 install ansible`. This will install Python 3 dependencies as well as ansible.
- Check [Ansible Repository](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#requirements) for requirements
- You will also need to make sure that Go is **not installed** on your VM / Machine. Setting up your full node through ansible will run into issues if you have Go already installed, as ansible requires specific packages of Go to be installed.
- You will also need to make sure that your VM / Machine does not have any previous setups for Polygon Validator or Heimdall or Bor. You will need to delete them as your setup will run into issues.
- The latest version, [Heimdall v.0.2.9](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v0.2.9), contains a few enhancements. The delay time between the contract events of different validators **has been increased** to ensure that the mempool doesn't get filled very quickly in case of a burst of events which could  hamper the progress of the chain. Additionally, the data size **has been restricted in state sync txs to 30Kb (when represented in bytes) and 60Kb (when represented as string)**. For example:

```bash

Data - "abcd1234"
Length in string format - 8
Hex Byte representation - [171 205 18 52]
Length in byte format - 4


```

## Full node setup for Testnetv4/Mumbai testnet

- Ensure you have access to the remote machine or VM that the full node is being set up on. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup) for more details.
- Clone the [`https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible`](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible) repo
- Get into the node-ansible folder: `cd node-ansible`
- Edit the `inventory.yml` file and insert your IP(s) in the `sentry->hosts` section. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory) for more details.
- Check if remote machine is reachable by running `ansible sentry -m ping`
- For a test run to confirm if the correct remote machine / VM is configured, run the following command:

```bash

ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.16 heimdall_branch=v0.2.9 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry heimdall_network=mumbai" --list-hosts

```

It should output the remote machine IP(s) you have configured:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/network/full-node-mumbai.png")} />

- Set up the full node with this command:

```bash

    ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.16 heimdall_branch=v0.2.9 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry heimdall_network=mumbai"

```

- In case you run into any issues, delete and clean the whole setup using

    `ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/clean.yml`

- Log in to the remote machine
- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`:
    - `moniker=<enter unique identifier>`
    - `seeds="4cd60c1d76e44b05f7dfd8bab3f447b119e87042@54.147.31.250:26656"`
- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`:
    - `eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Goerli>`
- Add the following flag in `~/node/bor/start.sh` to the `bor` start params:

```bash
--bootnodes "enode://320553cda00dfc003f499a3ce9598029f364fbb3ed1222fdc20a94d97dcc4d8ba0cd0bfa996579dcc6d17a534741fb0a5da303a90579431259150de66b597251@54.147.31.250:30303"
```

- In case you want to turn `trace` on for Bor, add the following flag to the `bor` start params in `~/node/bor/start.sh`:
    - `--gcmode 'archive'`

- Run the full node with the following commands:
    - `sudo service heimdalld start`
    - `sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start`

    Once Heimdall is synced, run

    - `sudo service bor start`

- Check logs:
    - Heimdall - `journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f`
    - Heimdall Rest Server - `journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f`
    - Bor - `journalctl -u bor.service -f`

- To check if Heimdall is synced
    - On the remote machine/VM, run `curl localhost:26657/status`
    - In the output, `catching_up` value should be `false`
