This section guides you through starting and running a full node on a binary.

For the system requirements, see [Minimum Technical Requirements](http://localhost:3000/docs/develop/network-details/technical-requirements).

:::note

Steps in this guide involve waiting for the Heimdall and Bor services to fully sync. This process takes several days to complete.

Alternatively, you can use a maintained snapshot, which will reduce the sync time to a few hours. For detailed instructions, see [Snapshot Instructions for Heimdall and Bor](https://forum.matic.network/t/snapshot-instructions-for-heimdall-and-bor/2278).

For snapshot download links, see [Polygon Chains Snapshots](https://snapshots.matic.today/).

:::note
You have to follow the exact outlined sequence of actions, otherwise you will run into issues.
:::


### Install build essentials

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### **Install GO**

```bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ssandeep/a6c7197811c83c71e5fead841bab396c/raw/go-install.sh
bash go-install.sh
sudo ln -nfs ~/.go/bin/go /usr/bin/go
```

:::note
Go version 1.17 is recommended.

### RabbitMq

RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software also known as a message broker or queue manager. Simply said; it is software where queues are defined, to which applications connect in order to transfer a message or messages.

A helper service called `bridge` which is embedded into Heimdall codebase requires `rabbit-mq` to queue transactions to multiple networks. Installing it should be pretty straightforward.

**Checkout the download instructions here: [https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)**

To start a RabbitMQ node, type:

```bash
rabbitmq-server
```

## Install Binaries

### Heimdall

Next, install the latest version of Heimdall and services. Make sure you git checkout the correct [released version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases).

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall
cd heimdall

# Checkout to a proper version
# For eg: git checkout v0.2.1-mumbai
git checkout <TAG OR BRANCH>
make install
```

That will install the `heimdalld` and `heimdallcli` binaries. Verify that everything is OK:

```bash
heimdalld version --long
```

### Bor

Next, install the latest version of Bor. Make sure you git checkout the correct [released version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/releases)

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
cd bor

# Checkout to a proper version

# For eg: git checkout v0.2.16

git checkout <TAG OR BRANCH>
make bor-all
sudo ln -nfs ~/bor/build/bin/bor /usr/bin/bor
sudo ln -nfs ~/bor/build/bin/bootnode /usr/bin/bootnode
```

That will install the `bor` binary and `bootnode` binary:

```bash
bor version
```

## Set up node files

### Fetch launch repo

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/launch
```

### Set up launch directory

To set up the network directory, network name and type of node are required.

Available networks: `mainnet-v1` and `testnet-v4`

Node types: `sentry` and `validator`

```bash
cd ~/
mkdir -p node
cp -rf launch/<network-name>/sentry/<node-type>/* ~/node

# To setup sentry node for mumbai (testnet-v4) testnet
# cp -rf launch/testnet-v4/sentry/sentry/* ~/node
```

### Set up network directories

**Heimdall data setup**

```bash
cd ~/node/heimdall
bash setup.sh
```

**Bor data setup**

```bash
cd ~/node/bor
bash setup.sh
```

## Set up service files

Download service.sh file

```bash
cd ~/node
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maticnetwork/launch/master/<network-name>/service.sh
# To setup sentry node for mumbai (testnet-v4) testnet
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maticnetwork/launch/master/testnet-v4/service.sh
```

Generate the metadata file
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/matic
sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/matic/
touch /etc/matic/metadata
```

Generate services files and copy them into system directory

```bash
cd ~/node
bash service.sh
sudo cp *.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

## Set up config files

**For Mumbai Testnet**

- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`:
    - `moniker=<enter unique identifier>`

```js
 seeds="4cd60c1d76e44b05f7dfd8bab3f447b119e87042@54.147.31.250:26656,b18bbe1f3d8576f4b73d9b18976e71c65e839149@34.226.134.117:26656"
```
- Configure the following in `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`:

    ```js
    eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Goerli>
    ```

- Add the following flag in `vi ~/node/bor/start.sh` to the `bor` start params:

```bash
--bootnodes "enode://320553cda00dfc003f499a3ce9598029f364fbb3ed1222fdc20a94d97dcc4d8ba0cd0bfa996579dcc6d17a534741fb0a5da303a90579431259150de66b597251@54.147.31.250:30303"
```

## Start services

Run the full Heimdall node with the following commands:

```bash
sudo service heimdalld start
sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start
```

Once Heimdall is synced, start Bor:

```bash
sudo service bor start
```

## Logs

Logs are managed by `journalctl` linux tool. Here is a link for advanced usage: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs)

**Check Heimdall node logs**

```bash
journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f
```

**Check Heimdall rest server logs**

```bash
journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f
```

**Check Bor rest server logs**

```bash
journalctl -u bor.service -f
```

### To check if Heimdall is synced

1. On the remote machine/VM, run `curl localhost:26657/status`
2. In the output, `catching_up` value should be `false`

### **Ports and firewall setup**

Open ports 22, 26656 and 30303 to world (0.0.0.0/0) on sentry node firewall.

You can use VPN to restrict access for port 22 as per your requirement and security guidelines.

## Install Binaries

### Heimdall

***This is required for your full node***

Next, install the latest version of Heimdall and services. Make sure you checkout the correct [released version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases) on Git. Note that the latest version, [Heimdall v.0.2.9](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v0.2.9), contains a few enhancements such as:
1. Restricting data size in state sync txs to:
    * **30Kb** when represented in **bytes**
    * **60Kb** when represented as **string**.
2. Increasing the **delay time** between the contract events of different validators to ensure that the mempool doesn't get filled very quickly in case of a burst of events which can hamper the progress of the chain.

The following example shows how the data size is restricted:

```
Data - "abcd1234"
Length in string format - 8
Hex Byte representation - [171 205 18 52]
Length in byte format - 4
```

Run the command:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall
cd heimdall

# Checkout to a proper version
# For eg: git checkout v0.2.9-mainnet
git checkout <TAG OR BRANCH>
make install
```

That will install the `heimdalld` and `heimdallcli` binaries. Verify that everything is OK:

```bash
heimdalld version --long
```

### Bor

***This is required for your full node***

Next, install the latest version of Bor. Make sure you checkout the correct [released version](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/releases) via Git

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
cd bor

# Checkout to a proper version

# For eg: git checkout 0.2.16

git checkout <TAG OR BRANCH>
make bor-all
sudo ln -nfs ~/bor/build/bin/bor /usr/bin/bor
sudo ln -nfs ~/bor/build/bin/bootnode /usr/bin/bootnode
```

That will install the `bor` binary and `bootnode` binary:

```bash
bor version
```

## Set up node files

### Fetch launch repo

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/launch
```

### Set up launch directory

To set up network directory, network name and type of node are required.

Available networks: `mainnet-v1`

Node types: `sentry` and `validator`

```bash
cd ~/
mkdir -p node
cp -rf launch/<network-name>/sentry/<node-type>/* ~/node

# To setup sentry node for Polygon mainnet
# cp -rf launch/mainnet-v1/sentry/sentry/* ~/node
```

### Set up network directories

**Heimdall data setup**

```bash
cd ~/node/heimdall
bash setup.sh
```

**Bor data setup**

```bash
cd ~/node/bor
bash setup.sh
```

## Set up service files

Download service.sh file.

```bash
cd ~/node
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maticnetwork/launch/master/<network-name>/service.sh
# To setup sentry node for mainnet (mainnet-v1)
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maticnetwork/launch/master/mainnet-v1/service.sh
```

Generate the metadata file:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/matic
sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/matic/
touch /etc/matic/metadata
```

Generate services files and copy them into system directory:

```bash
cd ~/node
bash service.sh
sudo cp *.service /etc/systemd/system/
```



## Set up config files

- Log in to the remote machine / VM
- You will need to add a few details in the `config.toml` file. To open the `config.toml` file, run the following command `vi ~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`

    Now in the config file you will have to change `Moniker` and add `seeds` information

    ```jsx
    moniker=<enter unique identifier> For example, moniker=my-sentry-node
    ```

    ```jsx
    seeds="f4f605d60b8ffaaf15240564e58a81103510631c@159.203.9.164:26656,4fb1bc820088764a564d4f66bba1963d47d82329@44.232.55.71:26656"
    ```

    - Change the value of **Pex** to `true`
    - Change the value of **Prometheus** to `true`
    - Set the `max_open_connections` value to `100`

    Make sure you keep the proper formatting when you make the changes above.

- Next you need to make changes in the `start.sh` file for Bor. Add the following flag in `vi ~/node/bor/start.sh` to the `bor` start params:

```bash
--bootnodes "enode://0cb82b395094ee4a2915e9714894627de9ed8498fb881cec6db7c65e8b9a5bd7f2f25cc84e71e89d0947e51c76e85d0847de848c7782b13c0255247a6758178c@44.232.55.71:30303,enode://88116f4295f5a31538ae409e4d44ad40d22e44ee9342869e7d68bdec55b0f83c1530355ce8b41fbec0928a7d75a5745d528450d30aec92066ab6ba1ee351d710@159.203.9.164:30303"
```

To enable Archive mode you can add the following flags in the `start.sh` file

```jsx
--gcmode 'archive' \
--ws --ws.port 8546 --ws.addr 0.0.0.0 --ws.origins '*' \
```

## Start services

Run these commands on your Sentry Node:

**To Start Heimdall Service**

```jsx
sudo service heimdalld start
```

**To start Heimdall Rest-server**

```jsx
sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start
```

You check logs for Heimdall and rest-server here:

- Heimdall - `journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f`
- Heimdall Rest Server - `journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f`

Now you need to make sure that **Heimdall is synced** completely and only then start Bor. If you start Bor without Heimdall syncing completely, you will run into issues frequently.

- To check if Heimdall is synced
    - On the remote machine/VM, run `curl localhost:26657/status`
    - In the output, `catching_up` value should be `false`

Now once Heimdall is synced, run

```jsx
sudo service bor start
```

You can check Bor logs here:

- Bor - `journalctl -u bor.service -f`
